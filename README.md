### Notes
- A few challenges I encountered was the layout structure of the folders because themes, colors, layouts, and Manifests did have a connection when I tried remove the ActionBar causing the default colors to change. 
- Also, understanding how to change the UI design, color, and style to add more data from the API required more research for the Glide library and the system documentation.
